# PyroPortal by Xavi

This is a simple module for <a href="https://github.com/WTFBlaze/PyroMod">PyroMod</a> i made to show some of the basics of VRC modding to a friend and how he could get started.

I might add more features later on if I feel like it or if people show interest in this module.

This module allows you to:
- Set infinite timer to your portals
- Delete other players portals
- Delete all player dropped portals
